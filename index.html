                        <div class="separator"><strong>THE BUSINESS PROBLEM</strong></div>
                        <br />
                        <p> Have you ever received a benefit package from an employer and felt that it was too
                            complicated to keep track of your spending amounts? Or can you recall a time when the
                            benefit reimbursement process was fast and free of hassle?

                            To address these increasingly common problems, the startup
                            <a href="https://www.getbenepass.com/"> Benepass</a> is combining
                            employer benefits and stipends on a single payment card in order to simplify and
                            modernize the benefits process. Benepass has an important pain point: When an employee from
                            Company X goes to a store and purchases something,
                            how can Benepass use the transaction data to assign it to a benefit category that the
                            employee is eligible for?</p>
                        <br />
                        <div class="separator"><strong>RESOURCES</strong></div>
                        <br />
                        <p> This project was performed as a 4-week independent consulting project, by which I was introduced to Benepass
                            through the <a href="https://insightfellows.com/data-science"> Insight</a> Data Science Program.
                            The data given to me by Benepass has a mixture of numerical, text, and categorical features
                            (green), data which I use for post-processing (yellow), as well as multiple labels (blue).
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p><img src="img/example_data.png" alt="" class="img-responsive center" /></p>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <p> In general, I overcame 3 significant challenges with this dataset: there were only 3 usable features,
                        the dataset was very small (350 rows), and the labels were highly imbalanced. To manipulate the data
                            and train a machine learning model I made use of the SMOTE, Pandas, and Scikit-learn libraries
                            in Python.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <div class="separator"><strong>SOLUTION</strong></div>
                        <br />
                        <p> I successfully created a multi-class classification model (called WhichBenefit)
                            which produces probability
                            scores for each class, where in most cases the predicted class can be taken as the
                            class with the highest probability. The model probabilities are then filtered through
                            a selection of benefits that a given employee is eligible for.
                            I implemented this data product into a
                            production-ready Python package which is now implemented in Benepass' live workflow.</p>
                        <br />

                        <br />
                        <div class="separator"><strong>IMPACT</strong></div>
                        <br />
                        <p> WhichBenefit adds business value by automating the classification of transactions into
                            benefit categories and by significantly increasing the performance over the
                            current approach. It also allows for new companies and transactions,
                            which will help Benepass scale up their production with minimal problems.
                            As a Python package, it is also adaptable such that the machine learning
                        model can be retrained and quickly replace the current model in the transaction pipeline. </p>
                        <br />

                        cash-based assistance in conflict regions. This is often due to the lack of pricing information for basic
                        necessities found in local markets. How can we estimate missing prices of market goods in Syria such that
                        families in need are given an adequate amount of aid?</p>

                        <a href="https://analytics-club.org/hack4good2019H"> Analytics Club</a> at ETH Z&uuml;rich. My team consisted of 3 other
                        university students of varying backgrounds, all of whom I had met for the first time. We were given 8 weeks to provide a
                        data analytics solution for our partner NGO, <a href="https://www.impact-initiatives.org/"> IMPACT Initiatives</a>, who
                        provided us with a sparse and unstructured dataset containing monthly market prices for regions across Syria.</p>

                        <p> Of the methods tested, we found two which proved to be most effective and which
                        showed the smallest nRMSE error after cross-validation: Adapted k-Nearest Neighbors (a-kNN) and Multiple Imputation
                        by Chained Equations (MICE). These approaches group the market price data in a hierarchical way such that
                        time-series analysis was performed before geographical grouping.</p>

                        <br />
                        <p> The solution we propose is simple and generalizable such that it can be implemented
                            with minimal costs and in other regions of conflict. We provided IMPACT Initiatives with
                            software written in Python and R as well as a more structured and fully imputed dataset.
                            They have communicated that they want to use this in their production level operations
                            in order to better inform the amount of assistance needed by these families. </p>

                        <p> Calculating the chemical energy of molecules in an accurate way is extremely time consuming,
                            even when using state-of-the-art methods on powerful computers. This can be attributed to
                            the poor scaling of computation time with respect to the number of atoms in the system.
                            How can we obtain accurate chemical energies while reducing the number of expensive computations?</p>

                        <p> In order to reduce the number of computations of the chemical energy (as well as its
                        first and second derivatives), my solution included only calculating the energy and its derivatives
                            at a few points along a multidimensional reaction pathway and using a regression technique to interpolate new points.
                            This was done with a kernel-based machine learning approach called Gaussian Process Regression, for which I
                        developed a modular Python code that will soon be released as open-source.</p>

                        <div class="separator"><strong>IMPACT</strong></div>
                        <br />
                        <p> Using Gaussian Process Regression,
                            I was able to drastically reduce the number of expensive calculations needed and
                            at the same time I obtained interesting scientific results for my research which would otherwise be unattainable.
                            The solution is generalizable to most chemical systems and since it is a Bayesian method, it does
                            not require the manual tuning of function parameters. I can also use it to obtain an explicit measure of
                            the error when predicting new energies.

                            fantasy sports has led to the use of data analytics to predict team and player performance.
                            This can be challenging for complex team sports, especially in fast-paced competitive leagues.
                            Using simple metrics, how can we predict a top-performing fantasy soccer team in the English
                            Premier League (EPL)?</p>

                            when competing with friends. I made use of open-source software such as Python, Jupyter, and
                            Matplotlib. The fantasy football data was obtained via requests from the official
                            <a href="https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/bootstrap-static/"> Fantasy Premier League API</a>.</p>

                        <p> As part of my solution I created a return on investment (ROI) measure for all players and
                        teams in the EPL. The ROI relates the total fantasy points earned by a player over the course of
                            the 38-week season to their purchase value and their number of minutes played.
                            From this analysis I was able to easily select
                            a mixture of high-ROI and high point-producing players within my budget constraints.</p>

                            which categorize the most valuable players by their positions. This functionality allows for
                            more manager flexibility such that should a player become injured, a replacement player can
                            easily be found for that corresponding position.</p>

                            I wanted to find up to 500 job listings on Indeed for full-time data scientist positions
                            within 50 miles of both Los Angeles and San Francisco. The data containing position, company,
                            city, job posting date, and job rating was parsed and aggregated into a .csv file. This data
                            was then easily visualized using Tableau to get a good understanding of where the jobs
                            are located with zip code granularity as well as the spread of job ratings.
